Notes to future self:

- util.py and other goodies can be found in [last year's repo][last-year]
- By [Eric's request][eric-request], input files are not included in this repo
  (todo, maybe: Make a private companion repo to this repo that contains my
  inputs and an easy way to clone both repos together)
